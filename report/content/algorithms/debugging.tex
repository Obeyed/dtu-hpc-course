\label{sec:debugging and profiling}

To debug we used two approaches; \ttt{printf()} for testing the logic of our application and \ttt{cuda-memcheck} to catch CUDA memory errors.
The \ttt{cuda-memcheck} is a command-line tool that informs the user about CUDA errors during runtime.
It can be used to find issues with memory access, thread ordering, race conditions and hardware reported program errors.
It is invoked as follows
%
\begin{quote}
  \ttt{cuda-memcheck [options] application-name [application-options]}
\end{quote}
%
As with the \ttt{nvprof} from \cref{sec:introduction to analysis of optimisation} the \ttt{cuda-memcheck} tool has a variety of flags for the option input.
In the option input \ttt{memcheck} is sat by default.
We further tested the option flag \ttt{racecheck}.
The \ttt{racecheck} allows us to detect write-after-write hazards, where two or more threads attempt to update the same memory location simultaneously.
