\section{GPGPU Memory Architecture}
\label{sec:gpgpu memory architecture}

This section aims to give a brief overview of the memory architecture of GPGPUs.

\Cref{fig:cpu gpu communication} illustrates the connections between the different layers of memory.
The data moves from the CPU's main memory, known as host memory, to the GPU's main memory, known as global memory.
From the global memory the data is dispatched to the global various SMs.
It is worth noticing that transfering data from host to global memory and from global memory to the SMs are very expensive operations as they are several magnitudes slower.

The L2 cache fetches data in a Least Recently Used (LRU) fashion, which means that it is built for temporal locality, i.e. recently accessed data is assumed to likely be used again in the near future.
\todo{is shared memory bandwidth the same for L1, L2, and SMEM?}
The L1 cache is designed for spacial locality, i.e. adjacent memory locations to the wanted data is also cached, with the assumption that neighbouring data will be used in the near future.
This means that the memory that is inside the SM is best suited for coalesced memory access (see \cref{sec:coalesced}).


\begin{table}[htb]

  \begin{tabular}{l r}
    \toprule
    memory & speed \\
    \midrule
    register & $\approx \SI{8000}{GB/s}$ \\
    shared   & $\approx \SI{1600}{GB/s}$ \\
    global   & $\SI{177}{GB/s}$ \\
    mapped   & $\approx \SI{8}{GB/s}$ \\
  \end{tabular}

\Cref{tab:hardware connections transfer rates} summarises the transfer rates of different connections of the different types of memory connections.
