\section{Do we ditch the CPU, and keep the GPU?}
\label{sec:cpu vs gpu}

It is true that a GPU has many more cores than a CPU, but these cores are significantly slower than the ones in a CPU.
These two processing units are developed with two different goals, and thus have different characteristics.

In general a CPU is a multi-purpose processing unit, whereas the GPU is a single-purpose compute-intensive processing unit.
The GPU has many more cores than the CPU, but the CPU's cores are much faster.
The memory hierarchy of a GPU enables it to efficiently compute instructions in parallel.
The CPU excels at sequential problems, that are not easily made parallel, because it is much faster.

Furthermore, GPUs do not have the features, e.g. interrupts and virtual memory, for modern operating systems.
One must consider a GPU as a compute-intensive problem solver, and nothing else.
