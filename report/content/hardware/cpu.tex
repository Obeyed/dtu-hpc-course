\section{CPU Architecture}
\label{sec:cpu}
The \textbf{Central Processing Unit (CPU)} is the processing unit in a modern day computer.
The CPU handles processing and control of data in the computer's memory space.
The CPU is usually made of a small amount of complex cores, known as Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU) that are optimized on reducing the latency of a given task.

The bottleneck of computation is often placed at the memory's ability to transfer data to/from the CPU, also known as I/Os.
To increase the I/Os the CPU has a built-in memory architecture with high speed, but low storage capabilities.
The optimized memory architecture allows the CPU the store, ``cache'', memory for later reuse and thus reduce the bottleneck.~\cite{bryant2003computer}
