\chapter{Building a Fast Histogram Algorithm}
\label{chap:fast histo}

In \cref{sec:histogram} we present our parallel implementation of the histogram algorithm.
The aim of the following sections is to present how we tried to boost the performance of the algorithm's running time.
Before we introduce the histogram implementation we introduce the transpose algorithm.
The next section present and describes what we did to try to boost the performance.
The following section presents what further thoughts we had that might have given better performance.
