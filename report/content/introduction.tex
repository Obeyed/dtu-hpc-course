\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This report documents our work with a special course in High Performance Computing at The Technical University of Denmark.
The project stretched over three weeks in January.

Throughout the development of this report, we mainly refer to the book in \cite{farber2011cuda}, by Rob Farber, and the online resource at \url{https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344}.

Moore's Law says that a processor's speed will double every year.
Statistics show that this statement has been correct for many years.
The challenge was to keep the processors cool while still increasing the speed.
Processor design moved from fast single-core to slower multi-core processor to overcome the heat challenge.
This reduced the amount of heat produced by the processor~\cite{schaller1997moore,bryant2003computer}.
