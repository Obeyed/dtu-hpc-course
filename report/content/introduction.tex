\label{chap:introduction}

This report is a documentation of Alexander and Elias' work during the special course ``High Performance Computing'' at the Technical University of Denmark.
The project stretched from 4'th of January 2016 to the 25'th of January 2016.

The development of this report is based on the book, ``CUDA - Application Design and Development'' by Rob Farber \cite{farber2011cuda} and the online course ``CS 344 - Introduction to Parallel Programming'' by John Owens and David Luebke \cite{udacity}.

Our code base developed throughout this course is publicly available.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/obeyed/dtu-hpc-course/tree/master/code}{https://github.com/obeyed/dtu-hpc-course/tree/master/code}}
