\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This report is a documentation of Alexander and Elias's work in the special course ``High Performance Computing'' at the Technical University of Denmark.
The project stretched from 4'th of January 2016 to the 25'th of January 2016.

The development of this report is based on the book, ``CUDA - Application Design and Development'' by Rob Farber \cite{farber2011cuda} and the online course ``CS 344 - Introduction to Parallel Programming'' by John Owens and David Luebke \url{https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344}.

Moore's Law states that a processor's speed will double every year.
Statistics show that this statement has been correct for many years.
The challenge was to keep the processors cool while still increasing the speed.
Processor design moved from fast single-core to slower multi-core processor to overcome the heat challenge.
This reduced the amount of heat produced by the processor~\cite{schaller1997moore,bryant2003computer}.
