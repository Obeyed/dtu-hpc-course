\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
In this project we described the fundamental difference between CPUs and GPGPUs.
We described the hardware and software specifications of working on a GPGPU in the CUDA environment.
We proposed challenges with optimising parallel code to run on a GPGPU.
We implemented a series of triviel and more advanced algorithms such as sort and an optmised version of histogram.
We used theory and debugging tools to analyse runtime and bottlenecks of the our implementations.
