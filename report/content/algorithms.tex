In the algorithms chapter we introduce four fundamental algorithms to that are often used in various combinations to model problems in parallel.~\cite{udacity}
We will be introducing map (\cref{sec:map}), reduce (\cref{sec:reduce}), scan (\cref{sec:scan}) and histogram (\cref{sec:histogram}).
Furthermore, we present the compact algorithm (\cref{sec:compact}), and radix sort (\cref{sec:radix sort}), which uses these basic algorithms to solve more complex problems.

Moreover, in the first three sections we present plots to illustrate the runtime's development while we expand the array size of the input from $2^0$ to $2^{29}$.
We performed these tests by running each array size 10 times and averaging the runtime results.
So, we ran $30 \times 10$ total runs for each test.
