\chapter{Hardware}
\label{chap:hardware}

In the hardware chapter we present the general architecture of multi-core CPU (\cref{sec:cpu}), general architecture of a GPGPU (\cref{sec:gpu}), GPGPU memory architecture (\cref{sec:gpgpu memory architecture}), parallel performance models (\cref{sec:parallel performance}) and a discussion of the difference between CPU and GPGPU (\cref{sec:cpu vs gpu}).
