\chapter{Hardware}
\label{chap:hardware}

This chapter presents the general architectures of a CPU and a GPU.
Furthermore, we present Amdahl's Law and Gustafson-Barsis Law, which discuss two different aspects of parallel execution compared to sequential execution.
We end the chapter by discussing why it is not a good idea to go all in with the GPU and no longer use a CPU.

    register & $\approx \SI{8000}{GB/s}$ \\
    shared   & $\approx \SI{1600}{GB/s}$ \\
    global   & $\SI{177}{GB/s}$ \\
    mapped   & $\approx \SI{8}{GB/s}$ \\

\end{table}

As a reference for this chapter, we present \cref{tab:hardware connections transfer rates} which summarises the transfer rates of different connections of the different types of hardware.
\todo{is shared memory bandwidth the same for L1, L2, and SMEM?}
We add \cref{fig:cpu gpu communication} to illustrate the connections these have.
