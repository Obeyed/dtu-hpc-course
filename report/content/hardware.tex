\chapter{Hardware}
\label{chap:hardware}

This chapter presents the general architectures of a CPU and a GPU.
Next, we present the memory architecture associated with GPU computing.
Furthermore, we present Amdahl's Law and Gustafson-Barsis Law, which discuss two different aspects of parallel execution compared to sequential execution.
We end the chapter with a brief discussion on the differences between CPU and GPU.
