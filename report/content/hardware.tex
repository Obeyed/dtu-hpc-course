\chapter{Hardware}
\label{chap:hardware}

This chapter presents the general architectures of a CPU and a GPU.
Furthermore, we present Amdahl's Law and Gustafson-Barsis Law, which discuss two different aspects of parallel execution compared to sequential execution.
We end the chapter by discussing why it is not a good idea to go all in with the GPU and no longer use a CPU.

First, we present \cref{tab:hardware connections transfer rates} which summarises the transfer rates of different connections of the different types of hardware.
We add \cref{fig:cpu gpu communication} to illustrate the connections these have.\todo{add table and figure}
