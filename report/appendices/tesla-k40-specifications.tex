\chapter{Tesla K40 Specifications}
\label{ap:tesla k40 specifications}

It is possible to fetch information about the installed GPUs by using a program called \ttt{deviceQuery}.
To locate the program, we print the contents of the \ttt{\$PATH} variable, and find the folder where CUDA was installed.
We find the exact program by running

\begin{quote}
  \ttt{find /appl/cuda/6.5/ -type f -name "deviceQuery"}
\end{quote}

\Cref{lst:tesla k40} presents the output given for our device, by running

\begin{quote}
  \ttt{/appl/cuda/6.5/samples/1\_Utilities/deviceQuery/deviceQuery}
\end{quote}
