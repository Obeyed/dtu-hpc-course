## Report

Use either `rake` or `make` to compile the report.
To use the make file, you need to install latexmk.
Run `sudo apt-get install latexmk` if you are on ubuntu.

* `rake` compiles report fully
* `rake clean` cleans everything unnecessary (this is done automatically with every compile)

* `make` compiles the report fully
* `make watch` will auto-compile the report on every file change
